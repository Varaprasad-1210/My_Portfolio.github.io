        <h2>Development of a College Placement Website using the MEAN Stack </h2>
        <h3>Abstract:</h3>
        <p>Placements can bring a wide range of benefits and opportunities. Training and management of placement is a crucial part of an educational institution. Our website with the help of latest technology called “MEAN Stack” which is stated as Mongo DB, Express JS, Angular, Node JS and Application program Interface(API) is the heart of our project .We use Angular as front-end and Express JS and Node JS as back-end to our website which improves the performance of our application. The main aim of this application is to provide detail view of students who got placed in different companies, details of placement committee of that educational institute, training programs that were conducting, placement statistics, information about the recruiters and some career guidelines. College Placement Guide Website is a static website in which admin can view and download the information about the student Recruitment.The paper presents the implementation details, challenges faced, and the future scope of the website.</p>
        <h3>Introduction:</h3>
        <p>College placement is a crucial aspect of the student's career. College Placement Guide website gives the detail information about the students placed in the past few years.Students can take the sample mock tests in this website based on the different companies under drives section.Admin can login and create the mock tests with exam title, description and few more details.In the about page students can know about the training placement officers information,recruiters information of that college.And in the training section users can know about the training programs,workshops and other technical programs conducted in that college. </p>
        <h3>Methodology:</h3>
        <p>The website is developed using the agile methodology. The agile methodology is a popular approach to software development that emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and incremental development. The agile methodology allows for the development team to adapt to changes quickly and deliver a working product in short iterations. The website is designed using responsive design. Responsive design is an approach to web design that allows the website to adapt to different screen sizes. The website is designed to provide a seamless user experience across different devices such as mobile, tablet, and desktop. </p>
        <h3>Technologies Used:</h3>
        <p>The MEAN stack is a popular web development stack that comprises four technologies: 
            <ul><li>Mongo DB </li><li> Express JS</li> <li>Angular JS</li> <li> Node JS </li></ul> 
            It is a full-stack JavaScript framework that allows developers to build dynamic web applications.
         </p>
